abstract = {Business email compromise scams (also known as ‘CEO fraud’) have cost companies $3.1bn in the past two years alone, according to the FBI. Indeed, spear-phishing is one of the biggest challenges facing enterprises today, with 84% of businesses having already suffered from an attack. Why is email fraud so effective? Too often, organisations use people, their weakest link, as their first line of defence. This presents a huge opportunity for cyber-criminals. The cost of phishing – in revenue, in data lost, in remediation and regulatory costs – is far too great to leave the email channel undefended. Estelle Derouet of Return Path explores the primary means of executing one of the most dangerous spear-phishing attacks today. And she offers some best practices for combating email fraud at the organisational level.}

ABSTRACT = {Phishing emails remain a primary vector for cyberattacks, necessitating advanced detection mechanisms. Existing studies often focus on limited datasets or a small number of models, lacking a comprehensive evaluation approach. This study develops a novel framework for implementing and testing phishing email detection models to address this gap. A total of fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are evaluated across ten datasets, including nine publicly available datasets and a merged dataset created for this study. The evaluation is conducted using multiple performance metrics to ensure a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that DL models consistently outperform their ML counterparts in both accuracy and robustness. Notably, transformer-based models BERT and RoBERTa achieve the highest detection accuracies of 98.99% and 99.08%, respectively, on the balanced merged dataset, outperforming traditional ML approaches by an average margin of 4.7%. These findings highlight the superiority of DL in phishing detection and emphasize the potential of AI-driven solutions in strengthening email security systems. This study provides a benchmark for future research and sets the stage for advancements in cybersecurity innovation.},

abstract = {As cybercrime increases, using email cautiously is crucial. Phishing emails are a major threat, often exploited to steal sensitive data and cause financial losses. While anti-phishing techniques exist, evolving phishing tactics make countering them challenging. This study proposes a phishing detection system using transformer-based word embedding and vector similarity search. Pre-trained models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) create high-dimensional vector embeddings from emails, stored in a vector database for real-time similarity searches. The proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning by automating feature extraction and improving similarity search efficiency, making it more effective in detecting phishing emails. Empirical evaluation has been conducted using three publicly available datasets Enron, Nazario phishing corpora, and the Phishing validation emails dataset. The system demonstrates the superior performance, achieving 98.43% accuracy, 98.44% precision, 98.38% recall, 98.41% F1-score, and an area under the curves (AUC) of 0.984 using cosine similarity.}

ABSTRACT = {Email phishing is a widespread cyber threat that can result in the theft of sensitive information and financial loss. It uses malicious emails to trick recipients into providing sensitive information or transferring money, often by disguising themselves as legitimate organizations or individuals. As technology advances and attackers become more sophisticated, the problem of email phishing becomes increasingly challenging to detect and prevent. In this research paper, the use of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), are explored for detecting email phishing attacks. A dataset of phishing and benign emails was utilized, and a set of relevant features was extracted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The proposed deep learning model was trained and tested using the dataset, and it was found that it can achieve high accuracy in detecting email phishing compared to other state-of-the-art research, where the best performance was seen when using BERT and LSTM with an accuracy of 99.61%. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for improving email phishing detection and protecting against this pervasive threat.},

ABSTRACT = {Phishing emails pose a significant threat to cybersecurity worldwide. There are already tools that mitigate the impact of these emails by filtering them, but these tools are only as reliable as their ability to detect new formats and techniques for creating phishing emails. In this paper, we investigated how traditional models and transformer models work on the classification task of identifying if an email is phishing or not. We realized that transformer models, in particular distilBERT, BERT, and roBERTa, had a significantly higher performance compared to traditional models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes. The process consisted of using a large and robust dataset of emails and applying preprocessing and optimization techniques to maximize the best result possible. roBERTa showed an outstanding capacity to identify phishing emails by achieving a maximum accuracy of 0.9943. Even though they were still successful, traditional models performed marginally worse; SVM performed the best, with an accuracy of 0.9876. The results emphasize the value of sophisticated text-processing methods and the potential of transformer models to improve email security by thwarting phishing attempts.},
