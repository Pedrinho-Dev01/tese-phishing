This article begins by defining what is phishing, and the four step process used by attackers:
1. Gaining trust - Usually through spoofing websites or pretending to be reputable email addresses
2. Redirection (Optional) - Using links to redirect users to malicious websites 
3. Gaining data - Obtaining sensitive data from users via forms in fake websites or replies in emails
4. Execution - Using the obtained data to perform malicious actions, such as stealing money or installing malware

Although phishing has been studied for more than two decades, it continues to grow in scale and sophistication. 
The authors argue that effective countermeasures must go beyond technical advancements and also include social, cognitive, educational, and legal perspectives.

The paper surveys major phishing incidents, such as the RSA 2011 breach, Google/Facebook invoice scam, and Twitter 2020 hack, 
showing how attacks evolved from simple email scams to large-scale operations involving malware and social engineering.
