\chapter{Work Proposal}

This chapter outlines the comprehensive work plan for the 2nd semester. 

\section{Work Plan and Timeline}

The project is structured into four main phases, each designed to build upon the previous stage and ensure a systematic approach to development. Each phase is allocated one month for completion, allowing for thorough implementation, testing, and refinement.

\subsection{Phase 1: Phishing Detection Model Development (February 2026)}

The initial phase focuses on developing a robust classification model capable of detecting phishing emails based on linguistic characteristics extracted from the text content. Leveraging the existing dataset, this phase includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing: Conducting exploratory data analysis on the existing dataset to understand its characteristics, distribution, and any preprocessing requirements for optimal model performance.
    
    \item Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant linguistic features including word frequency patterns, grammatical structures, URL characteristics, sender information patterns, and urgency indicators commonly found in phishing attempts.
    
    \item Model Selection and Training: Evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms (such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and deep learning approaches) to identify the most effective approach for phishing detection.
    
    \item Model Evaluation: Conducting rigorous testing using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and cross-validation techniques to ensure model reliability and generalization.
    
    \item Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters to achieve optimal performance while avoiding overfitting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis Model Development (March 2026)}

The second phase concentrates on building a specialized sentiment analysis model designed to identify emotional patterns characteristic of phishing attacks. Working with the existing dataset, this phase encompasses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sentiment Annotation Review: Examining and validating sentiment labels in the existing dataset, ensuring consistency and accuracy for effective model training.
    
    \item Emotional Pattern Identification: Analyzing phishing emails to identify common emotional triggers such as urgency, fear, excitement, and authority that attackers exploit.
    
    \item Model Architecture Design: Developing a sentiment classification model specifically tailored for email content, potentially utilizing transformer-based architectures or recurrent neural networks.
    
    \item Training and Validation: Training the sentiment model on the curated dataset and validating its ability to detect manipulative emotional patterns.
    
    \item Integration Planning: Designing the integration architecture to combine sentiment analysis with the phishing detection model for enhanced classification accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Web Application Development (April 2026)}

The third phase involves creating a user-friendly web application that serves as the interface for the phishing detection system. Key activities include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend Development: Designing and implementing an intuitive user interface that allows users to upload .eml files or paste email content directly into the application.
    
    \item Backend Implementation: Developing the server-side logic to process email content, invoke the classification models, and return results to the user interface.
    
    \item Model Integration: Incorporating both the phishing detection and sentiment analysis models into the web application backend, ensuring efficient processing and response times.
    
    \item Results Visualization: Creating clear and informative displays of classification results, including phishing probability scores, sentiment analysis outcomes, and explanations of detected suspicious patterns.
    
    \item Security Implementation: Ensuring the web application follows security best practices, including input validation, secure file handling, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
    
    \item User Experience Testing: Conducting usability tests to ensure the application is accessible and easy to use for individuals with varying technical backgrounds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 4: Review and Quality Assurance (May 2026)}

The final phase is dedicated to comprehensive review and refinement of all project components. This phase includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item System Integration Testing: Performing end-to-end testing of the complete system to identify and resolve any integration issues or performance bottlenecks.
    
    \item Model Performance Review: Conducting final evaluations of both models using additional test datasets to verify their effectiveness and reliability in real-world scenarios.
    
    \item Documentation Completion: Finalizing all technical documentation, including system architecture descriptions, model specifications, API documentation, and user guides.
    
    \item Code Quality Assurance: Reviewing all source code for adherence to best practices, proper documentation, and maintainability.
    
    \item Thesis Document Revision: Thoroughly reviewing and editing the written thesis document to ensure coherence, clarity, and academic rigor throughout all chapters.
    
    \item Final Presentation Preparation: Preparing materials for the final project presentation, including demonstrations of the web application and discussion of findings and contributions.
\end{itemize}
