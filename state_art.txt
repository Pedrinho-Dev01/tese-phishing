This chapter will detail how the techonologies relevant to this project have evolved.

E-mail and .eml

E-mail, short for electronic mail, is a method of exchanging messages over the internet or computer networks.
It is one of the most widely used forms of digital communication today, with billions of users worldwide.
As highlighted by Fernandes (2023), e-mail remains a central medium not only for legitimate communication but also as a 
primary attack vector exploited by cybercriminals through phishing and malware distribution (Fernandes, 2023).

From a technical perspective, e-mail is structured according to the Internet Message Format (RFC 5322), 
which defines the standard headers and body content of a message. Individual messages can be stored and exchanged as .eml files, 
a format that encapsulates the full message including metadata (headers), body text, and attachments using the MIME standard. 
The .eml format is particularly relevant in research contexts, as it preserves raw information such as authentication results, 
routing paths, and content features that are useful for forensic analysis and machine learning–based detection approaches (Fernandes, 2023).

As one of the most popular communication tools, e-mail has become a prime target for cyber attacks. 
Its widespread use, combined with the inherent trust users place in messages that appear legitimate,
makes e-mail an ideal vector for malicious actors seeking to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, 
or manipulate recipients into performing certain actions. Among the various threats that exploit e-mail, 
phishing has emerged as one of the most prevalent and damaging, leveraging social engineering techniques to
deceive users into revealing credentials, financial information, or other confidential data.

Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, 
such as usernames, passwords, or financial details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity through electronic communication channels, 
most commonly e-mail. Phishing attacks often employ social engineering tactics, exploiting users’ trust, fear, 
or curiosity, and can include malicious links, fraudulent websites, or deceptive attachments.

In 2024, according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), phishing attacks have been on a decline,
totaling 3.7 million attacks, down roughly 24% from 2023.

Although a decrease in attacks is a positive sign, phishing remains a significant threat due to its adaptability and 
the increasing sophistication of attacks. According to the IC3 2024 FBI report, phishing attacks resulted in the 
loss of 70 million dollars, clearly showing that phishing is still a relevant threat. 
(These attacks often coincide with larger data breaches, further magnifying their impact on organizations and individuals.)

To mitigate the threat of phishing, a wide range of technical solutions has been developed. 
These include email authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, which help verify the 
legitimacy of senders and reduce the likelihood of spoofed messages reaching users’ inboxes. (cite 1)

Transport-layer protections like MTA‑STS and TLS reporting further strengthen the security of email delivery, 
ensuring that messages are transmitted securely between servers and are less vulnerable to interception or tampering.

Additionally, advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches have been increasingly applied to detect phishing attempts. 
Models can leverage features extracted from email headers, body content, URLs, and attachments, 
with recent transformer-based architectures and embedding techniques providing state-of-the-art performance in 
identifying both traditional and sophisticated phishing messages. 

ML Approach

ML and DL approaches have been the subject of extensive research in the context of phishing detection.
Attackers have been using artificial intelligence to create more convincing phishing emails, and as such, 
researchers are increasingly focusing on developing robust detection mechanisms that can adapt to evolving threats.

As Fernandes (2023) highlights, traditional machine learning techniques are no longer sufficient to combat 
the sophisticated nature of modern phishing attacks. An extensive review is provided in his work, in machine learning (ML) and 
early deep learning (DL) for phishing detection. At the time, most systems relied heavily on engineered features extracted from 
emails: header fields (e.g. sender, Received chain), lexical/text cues (TF-IDF, bag-of-words), URL tokenization, 
structural HTML features, and attachment metadata. These feature sets were typically fed into classical classifiers 
like support vector machines (SVM), random forests, Naive Bayes, or logistic regression. Some early deep learning 
models—such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs)

Since then, there have been several significant advances in the ML/DL space for email-based phishing detection:

Pretrained transformer architectures (e.g. BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) have been fine-tuned for phishing detection tasks. 
These models effectively encode the email body, subject lines, and sometimes HTML structure into embeddings that capture 
semantic and contextual signals beyond simple lexical overlaps (cite 2).

Modern systems more often integrate multiple input modalities: authentication metadata (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), header features, 
embedding representations of textual content, URL encoders, HTML structure features, and outputs from attachment analysis 
or sandbox environments (cite 4 and 5).

Another technique used to detect phishing is vector similarity search. This technique involves converting raw emails into 
high-dimensional vectors using transformer embeddings. These vectors can then be compared to identify similarities between emails,
using methods such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Altough this approach yielded better results than traditional
ML techniques, it was still outperformed by fine-tuned transformer models. (cite 4)

Sentiment Analysis

While most research focuses on technical and structural features of phishing emails, a section of analysis that has been
largely overlooked is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
identify and extract subjective information from text, such as emotions, opinions, or attitudes. In the context of phishing detection,
sentiment analysis can provide insights into the emotional tone and persuasive strategies employed by attackers.

This can help cyber security professionals better understand the psychological tactics used, and possibly protect 
email users from said entity of being targeted by certain tactics, like blackmail.

In previous works, sentiment or tone was occasionally used as one auxiliary signal: existing works might include keyword frequency 
(urgency / fear words), lexical heuristics (e.g. counts of exclamation marks, imperative mood etc.). 
However, these were generally simpler, lexicon-based or manually curated features.

Most models prioritized content / URL / header / attachment features, leaving sentiment / emotional tone as a minor axis of research.
This, combined with the fact that in many datasets, the emotional manipulation was implicit rather than explicitly annotated,
meant that sentiment features were often noisy or under-utilized.

In a recent work, DistilBERT was used to extract embeddings that carry sentiment / tone information, that was fed 
into a classical classifier (SVM). This was compared to simply using SVM by itself, and the results showed that the sentiment-aware
model outperformed the baseline by a 3% margin in F1-score (97% vs 94%). (cite 7)

Another work, "Comparative Investigation of Traditional Machine-Learning Models and Transformer Models for Phishing Email Detection",
explicitly stated that results could be further improved by "incorporating sentiment analysis techniques to detect social-engineering 
tactics and to better understand the emotional tone and intent behind the email content" (cite 6).

As such, its clear that a well annotated dataset with sentiment labels, not just positive / negative labels, could provide
valuable insights into the emotional manipulation tactics used in phishing emails, and potentially improve detection performance.
