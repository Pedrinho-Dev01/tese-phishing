This chapter will detail how the techonologies relevant to this project have evolved.

E-mail and .eml

E-mail, short for electronic mail, is a method of exchanging messages over the internet or computer networks.
It is one of the most widely used forms of digital communication today, with billions of users worldwide.
As highlighted by Fernandes (2023), e-mail remains a central medium not only for legitimate communication but also as a 
primary attack vector exploited by cybercriminals through phishing and malware distribution (Fernandes, 2023).

From a technical perspective, e-mail is structured according to the Internet Message Format (RFC 5322), 
which defines the standard headers and body content of a message. Individual messages can be stored and exchanged as .eml files, 
a format that encapsulates the full message including metadata (headers), body text, and attachments using the MIME standard. 
The .eml format is particularly relevant in research contexts, as it preserves raw information such as authentication results, 
routing paths, and content features that are useful for forensic analysis and machine learning–based detection approaches (Fernandes, 2023).

As one of the most popular communication tools, e-mail has become a prime target for cyber attacks. 
Its widespread use, combined with the inherent trust users place in messages that appear legitimate,
makes e-mail an ideal vector for malicious actors seeking to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, 
or manipulate recipients into performing certain actions. Among the various threats that exploit e-mail, 
phishing has emerged as one of the most prevalent and damaging, leveraging social engineering techniques to
deceive users into revealing credentials, financial information, or other confidential data.

Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, 
such as usernames, passwords, or financial details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity through electronic communication channels, 
most commonly e-mail. Phishing attacks often employ social engineering tactics, exploiting users’ trust, fear, 
or curiosity, and can include malicious links, fraudulent websites, or deceptive attachments.

In 2024, according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), phishing attacks have been on a decline,
totaling 3.7 million attacks, down roughly 24% from 2023.

Although a decrease in attacks is a positive sign, phishing remains a significant threat due to its adaptability and 
the increasing sophistication of attacks. According to the IC3 2024 FBI report, phishing attacks resulted in the 
loss of 70 million dollars, clearly showing that phishing is still a relevant threat. 
(These attacks often coincide with larger data breaches, further magnifying their impact on organizations and individuals.)

To mitigate the threat of phishing, a wide range of technical solutions has been developed. 
These include email authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, which help verify the 
legitimacy of senders and reduce the likelihood of spoofed messages reaching users’ inboxes. (cite DEROUET20165)

Transport-layer protections like MTA‑STS and TLS reporting further strengthen the security of email delivery, 
ensuring that messages are transmitted securely between servers and are less vulnerable to interception or tampering.

Additionally, advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches have been increasingly applied to detect phishing attempts. 
Models can leverage features extracted from email headers, body content, URLs, and attachments, 
with recent transformer-based architectures and embedding techniques providing state-of-the-art performance in 
identifying both traditional and sophisticated phishing messages. 

ML Approach

ML and DL approaches have been the subject of extensive research in the context of phishing detection.
Attackers have been using artificial intelligence to create more convincing phishing emails, and as such, 
researchers are increasingly focusing on developing robust detection mechanisms that can adapt to evolving threats.

As Fernandes (2023) highlights, traditional machine learning techniques are no longer sufficient to combat the sophisticated nature of modern phishing attacks.
ML and DL techniques possess the ability to adapt to new and evolving threats, making them well-suited for phishing detection.
